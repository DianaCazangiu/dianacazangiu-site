      <p class="text-left">For the most of the people the most beautiful attraction remains always the sea.</p>
      <p>Every time when I have the opportunity to go in a trip I prefer to spend a few days on the sea, far from the crowded city.</p>
      <p>For the second time, I chose Cyprus.Being the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, Cyprus has one of the warmest climates in the Mediterranean part of the European Union. First time I was in Larnaca (with two years ago) in December and outside it was 24 Celsius degrees.</p>
      <p>As I expected this second experience on the island was a wonderful one. Here one can see beautiful landscapes (this is very good for photography amateurs) with colored flowers (especially lily of the valley), nice people (Cypriots are very hospitable and they know very well to get money from tourism) and I could notice that here were a lot of Russians.</p>
      <p>The Cyprus foods are really delightful.The spicy cuisine and sweets cooked with a lot of nuts and sugar are also met at the Turkey cuisine, but the island’s cuisine is closest to the  Greek gastronomy.</p>

      <p class="text-left">First day in Paphos was a mystic one. After many hours of staying awake (I had a very early flight) I arrived in Paphos airport at 9.30 in the morning. I was tired but it was no time for sleeping. I came here to explore the city, to visit the most important archeological treasures and to stay on the beach to enjoy the sun’s rays.</p>
      <p>After I let the luggage in the apartment where I had the accommodation, I decided to go on the beach. Because I came from the mountains city, I really needed to feel the sun and the sea water on my skin. It was enough time to visit every necessary place.</p>
      <p>One of the beautiful attraction in Paphos is the harbor. I was there in the second day and although it was a hot day I spend there an entire morning. I took a lot of pictures with different boats and I spent at least 3 hours to visit all the taverns with memories and different kind of sweets which were located everywhere on the beach.</p>
      <p>Paphos Archaeological Park covers most of the important ancient Greek and Roman City and is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its outstanding ancient remains.</p>
      <p>The most significant remains so far discovered are four large Roman villas: the House of Dionysos, the House of Orpheus, the House of Aion and the House of Theseus, all with superb preserved mosaic floors. </p>
      <p>In the same day, I visited the famous castle from Paphos (it’s near to the harbor). Maybe it has not a beautiful construction outside but the castle has a historical significance.</p>
      <p>Other important place in Paphos is Tomb of the Kings. I have done other 1.5 km till there, in the middle of the day, in the sun but this place is magic. For the most of people this is only a lot of rocks and columns but when you walk between the tombs the spiritual charge is huge.</p>
      <p>Every day, at the lunch time, each restaurant has a person outside who invite people to eat there. This means hospitability of the Cypriots and not only. There are a lot of Russians who live there and they are very nice with the foreigners and it’s easy to make friends there even if you don’t speak their language. </p>
      <p>Other important attraction in Paphos is Aphrodita rocks. This place is not so close to Kato region (where I lived) but it’s nice to visit it. It’s a legend which says that if you reach there and you swim around them of 20 times you will remain forever young and beautiful. I couldn’t do it this year (although I’m a professional swimmer) because I walk a lot and I was really tired. But I promise myself to do this next year.</p>
