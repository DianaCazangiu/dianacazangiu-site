      <p><strong>Hello everyone! Maybe you are wondering who am I. I'm a young latin woman with some Russian roots who likes to code, to write novels and to practice jogging and water sports (swimming, diving, surfing). And I like sailing too.  I'm an open-minded person and I have no fear to make new connection with people from other cultures and religions. I will always have something good to learn from everyone. I like to feel the sea waves touching my feet, I like to stay on the beach all day waiting for the sunset rising, I love to spend a day into a deep forest between palms and big tropical trees and yes, I love to travel all around the world, to discover archeological treasures.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Till now I travelled in almost all Europe in countries as France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain but I couldn't find my place anywhere. Sometimes I have the feeling that I don't belong here. Soon, when it will be the right moment I will start a new adventure somewhere outside of Europe. I will listen to my heart and it will lead me to the right place. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Professional speaking I’m an engineer with a PhD diploma in Mechatronics.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>During the time, I had different positions (software engineer, test development engineer, test engineer) mostly in engineering automotive companies but I was always attracted to scripting. For that reason with some years ago I left Romania and I start to work as freelancer in pentest IT branch. I travelled from a country to another and from a city to another according to customer location. It was a big challenge, I started from scratch and I survived for a few years alone, ouside of my country. </strong></p>
      <p><strong> I already was an English speaker but living in different European countries I was forced to learn different languages as German, French, Spanish, Italian and some Dutch. I worked all the time alone, no Team and no Boss behind. I received different tasks from my customer and my goal was to solve all the tasks with any possible means. In the most part of the time it was not easy, I had to study and work hard but it was no other choice. I had no one to help me or support me. I had just a manager to report the results and that was all. The code was all the time classified and my contact manager from the customer side was never interested in my working methods. I always wrote the code by my own from the scratch or making some research on web to find some references. My reporting manager was not able to support me technically but he was always a good friend. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>In this moment, I have a job which I really like and I work in a Team and I have no idea how to manage with this. I'm not used to interact with so many people or to present the code in front of them. There are still some lessons to learn.   </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Reaching to this point, I realized that I'm ready to make a new step in my carrier: maybe a new position, maybe to move in a new country. A small change is always welcome. I really like what I'm working now but it hurts like hell to see people addicted by computers, with no non-work communication related between them. I just wanted to make real friends indifferent of their culture, religion or race but it seems that this target is very hard to achieve in our days because people are very distant and they are not used anymore to communicate one each other. The friendship and human relations are something almost non-existent now and I'm afraid that the human race will be soon on the way to extinction. </strong></p>
