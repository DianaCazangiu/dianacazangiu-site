      <p><strong>Hello everyone! Maybe you are wondering who am I. I'm a young latin woman with some Russian roots who likes to code, to write novels and to practice jogging and water sports (swimming, diving, surfing). And I like sailing too.  I'm an open-minded person and I have no fear to make new connection with people from other cultures and religions. I will always have something good to learn from everyone. I like to feel the sea waves touching my feet, I like to stay on the beach all day waiting for the sunset rising, I love to spend a day into a deep forest between palms and big tropical trees and yes, I love to travel all around the world, to discover archeological treasures.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Till now I travelled in almost all Europe in countries as France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain but I couldn't find my place anywhere. Sometimes I have the feeling that I don't belong here. Soon, when it will be the right moment I will start a new adventure somewhere outside of Europe. I will listen to my heart and it will lead me to the right place. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Professional speaking Iâ€™m an engineer with a PhD diploma in Mechatronics.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>During the time, I had different positions (software engineer, test development engineer, test engineer) mostly in engineering automotive companies but I was always attracted to scripting. For that reason with some years ago I left Romania and I start to work as freelancer in pentest IT branch. I travelled from a country to another and from a city to another according to customer location. It was a big challenge, I started from scratch and I survived for a few years alone, ouside of my country. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Living alone between foreign people is not always easy. When I arrived in Belgium, in Leuven, a city near Bruxelles, in 2012, I was for the first time outside of my country with no one beside me and with only few money in my wallet. This first day was the hardest one. But day by day I became stronger, I learned how to survive alone. In time, I made some friends there (not many because Belgian people are not so friendly), I worked a lot, I travelled a lot visiting different cities and I took some pictures. The Flemish part of Belgium seems to me most beautiful one but I have a special attraction for Brugge. After few months spent there I said Good Bye to Belgium and I continued my journey. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The next destination was France. In the most part of the time I lived in a small village near Limoges. To live in France it was a big challange for me. When I arrived there I was expecting that the work colleagues to speak in English with me. But this was not happened. They were from different African or Asian countries like Iran, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. These guys were in France to study and work for a better future. They all were very kind with me and day by day, they helped me to learn French. These people treated me like a sister, they received me in their Muslim community and they were my family there. I participated to their Muslim celebrations as Sheep Day, Ramadan (the most important Muslim celebration) and when I left France I had tears in my eyes because I was feeling that a big part of my heart will remain with them forever. But I had no other choice. I had to move in another country to work for other customer.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> For a short period I got a contract in South of Italy and I went there. Italy is a beautiful country and Italian people are very friendly but I couldn't make any connection there. I did my work, I visited a few places and when my contract finished I left. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Reaching in Germany was another big challange for me. I already had a background in IT pentesting branch behind so it was not so difficult to do my job. But the interaction with my colleagues was a problem because I didn't speak German in that time. There was only an English speaker colleague who help me to adapt there. But parallely with my work I started studying German language. This was a must if I wanted to make friends there. In 3 months I already was an intermmediate German speaker but German people were not ready to accept me there. So, after 3 month of living in Nurnberg area, I travelled to Munich for other customer. There I met two Indian colleagues and they introduced me in their community. At the beginning I had no idea how to manage this because I never met Indian people before but the both of them protected me all the time, they helped me even when other European people abandoned me and they offered something that I never had in Romania: a big happy family. I celebrate with them all the important Indian celebration, as Diwali and for the first time in my life I felt that I'm a part of something.  I lived for 6 months beside them, in their community working together and when I left for the first time I cried. Because I felt that all my heart will rest with them forever. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>I didn't stop travelling. I returned to Belgium, in Bruxelles for the next customer. But for this time I just worked, with no interaction with collagues because I didn't want to suffer again. I also lived for a few months among Moroccan, Turkish and African black people but I avoided to attach to anyone. I visited alone other part of Belgium and when the virus was spreaded into the whole world I left Bruxelles and I retreated in a small Belgian village at the French border, in Wevelgem. I lived almost three month there in a company of a beautiful cat. It was an interesting village, situated near a forest and a big lake. I practiced sport a lot in that period and I enjoyed each day spent there. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>After three months, when the border with Netherlands was opened I continued my journey. I arrived in Utrecht and for a while I lived there even if outside it was a dangerous virus. I was not scared because I knew that I'm protected by forces which no one was ready to interact with. I worked there alone and I avoided any interaction with other colleagues because I didn't want to attach to anyone. I was a traveller and to start a relationship was not in my plan. I visited some important cities, as Amsterdam, Eindhoven and when I left I had no regrets. </strong></p>
      <p><strong> Being still impossible to return in my country because some stupid regulations, I went in Germany again, but for this time there was no customer. I just wanted to be safe and I returned to Munich at my Indian friends. I needed them beside. I was not ready to say them Good Bye. The both were happy to see me again and they received me in their house. And in that moment I knew that I will always have a place in their heart. They helped me again, they protected me and they kept me in safe till I was able to travel again but for this time to my country. And when I left I promised that each year I will spend with them the first day  of Diwali celebration. </strong></p>
      <p><strong> I already was an English speaker but living in different European countries I was forced to learn different languages as German, French, Spanish, Italian and some Dutch. I worked all the time alone, no Team and no Boss behind. In this IT branch a Team is not required. Being a Gray Hat I was like a ghost for everyone. I received different tasks from my customer and my goal was to solve all the tasks with any possible means. In the most part of the time it was not easy, I had to study and work hard but it was no other choice. I had no one to help me or support me. I had just a manager to report the results and that was all. The code was all the time classified and my contact manager from the customer side was never interested in my working methods. I always wrote the code by my own from the scratch or making some research on web to find some references. My reporting manager was not able to support me technically but he was always a good friend. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>In this moment, I have a job which I really like and I work in a Team and I have no idea how to manage with this. I'm not used to interact with so many people or to present the code in front of them. There are still some lessons to learn. But in time I'm sure that I will manage this. First time when I start working on this project and my contact manager said me that I will work with Indian people, I was really happy. I though that if it was easy for me to interact with Indians in Munich, now it will be the same but I was wrong. My colleagues are good people but it's still difficult to communicate with them. The most of them are still distant because they don't know me and I'm not sure that it will be a chance to know each other. I'm feeling that I'm already atttached of one of them and I always leave.  </strong></p>
