      <p><strong>Hello everyone! Maybe you are wondering who am I. I'm a young latin woman with some Russian roots who likes to code, to write novels and to practice jogging and swimming.  I'm an open-minded person who  always search for the beauty in all my passions. I accept all the people as they are and I have no fear to make new connection with people from other cultures. Always I will have something good to learn. I like to feel the sea waves touching my feet, I like to stay on the beach all day waiting for the sunset rising, I love to spend a day into a deep forest between palms and big tropical trees and yes, I love to travel all around the world, to discover archeological treasures.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Professional speaking Iâ€™m an engineer with a PhD diploma in Mechatronics.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>During the time, I had different positions (software engineer, test development engineer, test engineer) mostly in engineering automotive companies but I was always attracted to scripting.Even if there were not the jobs of my dream I always learnt something new.</strong></p> 
      <p><strong>In this moment, I have a job which I really like and I work with the team of my dream. So,I decided to go to the next step: to write my first novel which will be uploaded here soon. </strong></p>
