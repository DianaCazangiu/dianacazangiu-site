      <p><strong>Hello everyone! Maybe you are wondering who am I. I'm a young latin woman with some Russian roots who likes to code, to write novels and to practice jogging and water sports (swimming, diving, surfing). And I like sailing too.  I'm an open-minded person and I have no fear to make new connection with people from other cultures and religions. I will always have something good to learn from everyone. I like to feel the sea waves touching my feet, I like to stay on the beach all day waiting for the sunset rising, I love to spend a day into a deep forest between palms and big tropical trees and yes, I love to travel all around the world, to discover archeological treasures.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Till now I travelled in almost all Europe in countries as France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy but I couldn't find my place anywhere. Sometimes I have the feeling that I don't belong here. Soon, when it will be the right moment I will start a new adventure somewhere outside of Europe. I will listen to my heart and it will lead me to the right place. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Professional speaking Iâ€™m an engineer with a PhD diploma in Mechatronics.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>During the time, I had different positions (software engineer, test development engineer, test engineer) mostly in engineering automotive companies but I was always attracted to scripting. Even if there were not the jobs of my dream I always learnt something new.</strong></p> 
      <p><strong>In this moment, I have a job which I really like and I work with the team of my dream. So, I decided to go to the next step: to write my first novel. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Reaching to this point, I realized that I'm ready to make a new step in my carrier: maybe a new position, maybe to move in a new country. A small change is always welcome. I really like what I'm working now but it hurts like hell to see people addicted by computers, with no non-work communication related between them. I just wanted to make real friends indifferent of their culture, religion or race but it seems that this target is very hard to achieve in our days because people are very distant and they are not used anymore to communicate one each other. The friendship and human relations are something almost non-existent now and I'm afraid that the human race will be soon on the way to extinction. </strong></p>
