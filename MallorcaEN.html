      <p class="text-left">Mallorca is the largest island situated in the Balearic Islands and located in the Mediterranean Sea. The native language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is a dialect of Spanish language.</p>
      <p>On the island there are some of the Mediterranean's most beautiful bays and beaches: gold sand beaches with a full range of services, but there are small bays situated between cliffs and pine groves in the north of the island. The water is clean, ideal for swimming and water sports such as scuba diving, windsurfing, fishing, sailing, and even surfing. </p>
      <p>Mallorca is characterized not only by sea and beaches. There are mountains and forests, too. There it’s located Sierra de Tramuntana Mountains, in the north, with peaks reaching over 1,400 m above sea level, and the Cabrera Marine and Terrestrial Nature Reserve, a group of islands and islets, where it’s easy to reach by boat.</p>
      <p>Culture is a vital part of the life of the island. During the year there are festivals, concerts, literary events, exhibitions... The capital, Palma de Mallorca, is the island's cultural center, which is famous by its historic old town and excellent night life.</p>

    <p class="text-left">My first day in Mallorca was a great experience. It was my first travel outside of Romania and yes, I was motivated to discover new culture and traditions. I arrived there in the evening and after my first flight I expected to be tired. But to my surprise I was not tired at all. So, in my first evening there I was in the city center to take dinner in a Japanese restaurant. I ate for the first-time sushi, algae salad and different Asian foods and I was amazed. After that I was with my friends who live there in a cinema to see an action movie (the subtitle was in Spanish, but it was ok even if my Spanish is not so advanced).</p>
    <p>In this trip I entered in contact with their culture and their traditions and I was surprised to see that people are very relaxed there, they wear mostly sport and casual clothes and they don’t care how they look like. Men and women stay alone on the beach, on the terraces of the coffee-bars and restaurants enjoying their drinks and foods and they know to live their life.</p>
    <p>Before coming in Mallorca, I supposed that there is only beach here. I was very surprised when I found out that there are mountains too. It’s easy to reach to the mountains by a special train who go from Palma center to Soller Port.</p>
    <p>I didn’t have enough time to visit the Cathedral and the Castle (these were little far from my location) but I could visit the Aquarium (where I could see different kind of fishes) and I visited different beaches because I have a special attraction from the sea and all the water sports.</p>
    <p>There are different nationalities on the island. The most part are locals who speak all the time Catalan (with the tourists they can speak Spanish) but one can meet a lot of people from East of Europe (Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian and Russians too). On the island is no industry but investors from the reach countries (like Germany and Sweden) moved here and opened many businesses here based by tourism. And year by year they gain a lot of money because Mallorca is an attraction for all the Europe.</p>
